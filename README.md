# 🚀 C-RAG: Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation

C-RAG is a modular implementation of a Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to improve answer reliability by validating, filtering, and refining retrieved context before final generation.

---

## 📌 Features

- Document retrieval  
- Context grading  
- Strip extraction and filtering  
- Context refinement  
- Verified final answer generation  

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Standard RAG systems often:

- Retrieve partially relevant documents  
- Use weak context directly in generation  
- Hallucinate when retrieval quality is low  

C-RAG introduces a corrective layer that:

- Grades retrieved documents  
- Extracts relevant text strips  
- Filters weak or noisy context  
- Refines context before final generation  

This results in a more reliable and interpretable RAG pipeline.

## ▶️ Usage

Modify the query inside `main.py`:

```python
run({
    "question": "Batch normalization vs layer normalization",
    "docs": [],
    "good_docs": [],
    "verdict": "",
    "reason": "",
    "strips": [],
    "kept_strips": [],
    "refined_context": "",
})
```

Run:

```
python main.py
```
